"""Serveradmin - igvm_migration_log cleanup

We are using igvm_migration_log for calculating the overall CPU usage of a
Hypervisor. This is obsolete after the next prime time because the cpu_util_pct
will be correct again. This task will get executed once in the morning to
clean up the log entries from the previous day.
